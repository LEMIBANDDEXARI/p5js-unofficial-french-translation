[Read in French](https://github.com/LEMIBANDDEXARI/p5js-unofficial-french-translation) | Here is the unofficial French translation of [p5.js](https://p5js.org) as [limzykenneth](https://github.com/limzykenneth) suggested it to me [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/5180).
# Important thing
- 0.0.1 (not yet available - in progress) - This French translation of p5.js is based on a version of the repo [processing/p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) which dates from April 21, 2021 09:38(UTC+2)

## [Unofficial French version of p5.js](###)
This version will soon be hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) ðŸ’› when I would have done the whole translation, or at least a large part of it.
